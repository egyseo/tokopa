          <h2>Praise for Toko-pa Turner’s BELONGING</h2>
          <p>"An exquisitely crafted journey that explores the deep longings of the soul, the mysterious workings of our dreams, the bittersweet wisdom of the orphaned self and the losses of our lineage that we would rather ignore. Toko-pa Turner speaks with poetry and practicality, pure compassion and profound integrity to the heart of what it means to belong to ourselves, to our people, to our communities and to the earth. Belonging is the book I have been longing to read all my life." <strong>—Lucy H. Pearce, Amazon bestselling author, Burning Woman, Moon Time, The Rainbow Way</strong></p>

      <div class="about__bottom">
        <p>"With astounding clarity and compassion Toko-pa guides us to embody a humanity deeply rooted in our belonging and reverence for the grand dance of life we are part of. Through her exquisite word-magic, she midwifes the deep wisdom of our souls into incarnation." <strong>—Chameli Ardagh, Founder Awakening Women Institute</strong></p>

        <p>"Certain people invite you into an experience that will alter your world view forever. They have gone so deep, searched so thoroughly, traversed territories that most would shun, and then they return and lay their soul at your feet. Toko-pa is one such individual and this book is her soul made visible. She reaches her hand out to you and asks you to take a journey with her. If you are ready, take her hand and prepare to grow." <strong>—Clare Dubois, International speaker and founder of TreeSisters</strong></p>

        <p>"Belonging is something quite extraordinary. It’s more than just a book; it’s an experience. As I read Toko-pa’s writing, I found myself being transported, not to some distant place, but to my deepest core. Belonging is a mirror to our true face, revealing the exiled threads of our being so that we may gently re-weave them back into the greater fabric of which we are all a part. This is a book that provides living nourishment for these times and will be a classic for decades to come." <strong>—Bethany Webster,  writer, transformational coach, international speaker</strong></p>

        <p>"Belonging is full of profound insights that flower from Toko-pa’s powerful life experiences and her resilient, compassionate spirit. It was breathtakingly compassionate and surefooted! Toko-pa has a poetic way of writing and thinking that makes her prose a constant surprise. There were many turns of phrase that were just so original and insightful that I wanted to linger in those gardens of words." <strong>—Michelle Tocher, Mythologist & Author of "Brave Work, The Tower Princess, How to Ride a Dragon</strong></p>

        <h2>On Belonging…</h2>
        <p><strong>We live in one of the most connected times on earth</strong> but never before have we been so lonely, so alienated from each other, from ourselves, and from the natural world. Whether this manifests as having difficulty finding community, feeling anxiety about your worthiness and place in the world, or simply feeling disconnected, the absence of belonging is the great silent wound of our times.</p>

        <p>Most of us think of belonging as a place outside of ourselves, that if we keep searching for, that maybe one day we’ll find it. But what if belonging isn’t a place at all, but a set of skills, or competencies, that we in modern times have lost or forgotten.</p>

        <p>In <em>Belonging</em>, Toko-pa explores the origins of our estrangement, how that alienation affects the choices we make as individuals, and as a culture, and what are those skills to which we can apprentice ourselves, to restore a sense of belonging in our lives, and in our world.</p>

        <blockquote>"I loved this book so much, I wanted to eat it." <strong>–CM</strong></blockquote>

        <p><strong>Belonging</strong> won the prestigious <strong>2017 Gold Nautilus Award</strong> for its contribution to the field of Personal Growth, the <strong>2018 Gold Readers’ Favourite Award</strong>, <strong>2018 Silver IPPY Award</strong>, <strong>Finalist 2018 Whistler lnde­pendent Book Award</strong>, and <strong>Finalist 2019 Montaigne Medal</strong> in the <strong>Eric Hoffer Book Awards</strong>.</p>

        <h3>about the author…</h3>
        <p><strong>Toko-pa Turner</strong> is an author, teacher and dreamworker. Blending the mystical tradition of Sufism in which she was raised with a Jungian approach to dreamwork, she founded the Dream School in 2001 from which hundreds of students have since graduated.</p>

        <p>Toko-pa has been interviewed by CNN News and BBC Radio and has a community of over 100,000 online readers. Her writing has been published worldwide, and she is currently releasing her first book Belonging, which explores the themes of exile, and the search for belonging.</p>

        <p>Sometimes called a Midwife of the Psyche, Toko-pa’s work focuses on restoring the feminine, reconciling paradox, and facilitating grief and ritual practice.</p>
